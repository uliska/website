<span class="OLL">musicexamples</span> is a set of tools to manage musical examples in LaTeX documents.
It was developed with scores in mind that are created using LilyPond, but it works equally well with any kind of image files.
There are three parts to <span class="OLL">musicexamples</span>: a LaTeX package, LilyPond configuration files and Python scripts.

The *LaTeX package* can be used as a standalone tool, without using the other two parts, and without even using LilyPond at all.
It provides floating and non-floating environments to place examples in, and commands to print music examples with one or more systems as well as full-page examples.
All example types share a common counter and can be listed in one contigious `\listofmusicexamples`.  
Great care has been taken to sensibly deal with full-page examples starting on odd or even pages:
Depending on the presence of the respective score files (tagged by file name) full-page examples start at the very next page or at the next odd/even page.  
The package can work with pdf files created by LilyPond, with snippets created by <code>lilypond-book</code> or with any other image files that LaTeX can process.  
Apart from a few wishes and minor bugs the LaTeX package is more or less finished and can already be used.

The *LilyPond configuration files* are intended to simplify the generation of  examples with LilyPond.
Configured by a few variables in the main `.ly` file they take care of the correct compilation and after-compilation cleanup to provide the right pdf file(s) to be used with the LaTeX package. 
This part isn't quite ready yet.

The *Python scripts* will be used to keep track of LilyPond-generated examples.
This can be used to automatically recompile all changed LilyPond examples, for example after a change of layout configuration files. 
Work on these has not begun yet &ndash; any assistance is highly welcome.

As with the <span class="OLL">lilyglyphs</span> package development has reached a usable state but there is no binary release availably at the moment.
You may read the [Manual v0.2](@root_path/public/manuals/musicexamples_0-2.pdf) and you can get the package through its [GitHub repository](https://github.com/openlilylib/musicexamples).
