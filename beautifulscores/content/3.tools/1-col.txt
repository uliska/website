content:
As mentioned plain text tools can be highly configured by
developing libraries and tools or by extending their editing
environments.

On this page we'll present a few of the tools
we have developed or that we're busy with.  Please note that
this is only an excerpt of existing material intended to give
you a first impression.  Please note also that we can develop
individual solutions for your projects, jobs or business
if necessary.

#### LaTeX Commands
With LaTeX you can define commands that are somewhat similar 
but significantly superior to formatting stylesheets.
Depending on the use case you can treat arguments like fields
of datasets and thus can use a LaTeX file to efficiently
store data.  For example one could store entries for a critical
report in a structured manner:

~~~

\entry{5}                  % measure
      {2. crotchet}        % position in measure
      {piano}              % instrument
      {Ms.: no accidental} % comment
test2

~~~

Through the means of including different stylesheets for production
or during development one can significantly alter the result of
such commands.  We have written a
[blog post](http://lilypondblog.org/2013/12/using-latex-for-a-musical-edition/)
on the subject where you can see an example of such a command laid out
for easy comprehension while editing and neat layout for the printed
result.

#### lilyglyphs
We have developed [lilyglyphs](http://openlilylib.org/lilyglyphs),
a LaTeX package that can include *any* notation that can
be achieved with LilyPond into continuous text of a LaTeX text
document.  This is probably the most verstatile and beautiful solution
for using notational elements in texts.  While it was developed with
critical reports in mind this package can very well be used in the
main body of musicological books.

#### Editorial Toolbox
We have created a library of useful LilyPond functions for editorial
purposes. They provide consistent decoration of editorial elements
in a score (e.g. amendments or additions) and tools for “in-source
communication” which you can understand as a kind of short message
service between different editors of a file.  One nice touch about
it is that the elements are highlighted through colors while one is
still developing the score.

One particular goal which is still under development is a package
called `\annotate`.  This will allow an editor to enter arbitrary
annotations directly in the score file.  Apart from being used as
another communication channel these annotations will ultimately
be processed so they can be used as input for critical report
commands in LaTeX documents.  So it will be possible to perform *the
whole editing process* up to the critical report in the context of
the actual score! 

#### Extending the IDEs: Layout Control Mode
Not only Lilypond and LaTeX are extensible open source projects,
also many of the available editing environments can be modified,
developed or adjusted to one's personal needs.  From the idea of
creating a specific *draft mode* that visualizes internal aspects
while one is still developing a score we created a new tool for
our LilyPond editor of choice, [Frescobaldi](http://www.frescboaldi.org):
The *Layout Control Mode* which allows you to display a range of
useful information on a temporary basis. Read somewhat more on
our [introductory blog post](http://lilypondblog.org/2013/10/preview-mode-preview/).

Please note that also aspects like the in-source annotations or the
critical report entries can - and will - be “treated” with similar
extensions of the IDE
