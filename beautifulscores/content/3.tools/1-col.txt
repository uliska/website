content:
Demonstrate a few of the specific tools we have developed:

- Use of LaTeX with "datasets" and alternative layout
- LilyPond Draft Mode and Layout Control Mode
- `\annotate`
- etc. ?

These are more "pitch" examples than a thorough overview.  
Maybe point out the option to tailor such solutions
to the customer's needs.
