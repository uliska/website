While LilyPond has extensive [documentation](http://www.lilypond.org/manuals.html) that is really excellent compared to many other open source software packages there are still situations where new and even advanced users would be glad about some more elaborate explanations.
Apart from the [Learning Manual](http://www.lilypond.org/doc/v2.16/Documentation/learning/index.html) the documentation is mostly a *reference* and obviously somewhat hard to get used to for beginners.
This is where our tutorials strive to chime in.
They concentrate on one single topic each, and can afford to dwell on that as long as its author considers appropriate.
As the collection will grow, we may consider tailoring the contributions towards a coherent book, but for now we will simply regard it as a collection of independent texts.

This is intended to be an open platform and we really welcome any contribution of articles, long or short.
We hope to gather a substantial collection of knowlegde over time.
Anybody who has mastered an issue with the help of the community is encouraged to give something back by contributing to this collection of resources.
For example we would love to host the tutorial that would have helped you to master that particular issue without asking for help.

Tutorials are delivered either as pdf files or as blog posts, and all of them are presented in the [tutorials](http://lilypondblog.org/category/tutorials/) category in the [Scores of Beauty](http://lilypondblog.org) LilyPond blog.
