Some fundamental information about the underlying concepts and tools:
LilyPond, LaTeX, and Version Control.

This should be no in-depth discussion but merely a primer, referring
either to sub-pages or to external resources such as our blog posts. 

Main attention would go to *plain text* and *version control*, which
can be even introduced in detail. For particular ideas about LilyPond
and LaTeX this should refer to the [Tools](tools/) page.
