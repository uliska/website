It can't be stressed enough that the experiences we made during
the past two years really turned our ways of working upside down.
Incorporating workflows and tools from computer science into
musical editing made us reconsider everything we knew
about working, and working in team particularly.

The list of benefits provided by plain text tools and workflows
is rather long.  On this website we can only give a few spotlights
on its items.  If you're interested in learning more about it
we suggest to read our
[in-depth essay](http://lilypondblog.org/2013/07/plain-text-files-in-music/)
or visit our [blog](http://lilypondblog.org) in general.

The following aspects are to greater or lesser extent applicable
to the benefits of our services as document providers or to being
implemented in your own business.  But we're quite positive
that you should definitely find something that relates to you
and your requirements.

- *Seamless (realtime) collaboration*  
- *Peer review* can be incorporated as a constant factor at any level.
- *Crowd Engraving* to speed up delivery
- *Joining the process* to save money or gain control
- *Long-term reliability* through self-documenting projects.
- *Integration of text and music* with LilyPond and LaTeX
- *Flexibility* to tailor the environment to your individual needs
- *Specialists for specific needs* can join projects on demand
