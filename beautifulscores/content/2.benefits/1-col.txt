The list of benefits provided by plain text tools and workflows
is rather long. Actually we can't imagine how we could ever have
worked efficiently before that. We're confident that you'll find
aspects relating to you, your working style or business requirements
in the following list.

- *Seamless collaboration*  
Working together on the same files simultaneously -- without having to worry about stepping
on each other's toes -- makes for very smooth workflows and improves overall quality
through constant peer review by design.
- *Long-term reliability*  
Projects are self-documenting (through version control), and updating documents even after
publication is a straightforward and transparent process, without the risk of compromising
any existing work. This is particularly valuable for long-term projects like complete
editions or other publication series.
- *Integration of text and music*  
The compilation of scores and textual parts into a contigious document happens in the
shared data repository too, so the complete volume can be maintained in the
same environment as the individual parts, without the need of passing around documents
between different editors and tools.
- *Flexibility*  
Working environments can be fine-tuned to a remarkable degree. This comprises house
style libraries, enforcment of typographical standards, data processing etc.
- *Crowd Engraving*
- *Joining the process*
- *Specialists for specific needs*
- *Individual solutions*
- *Fair and transparent pricing*
