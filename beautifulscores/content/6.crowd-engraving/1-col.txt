### Seamless Online Collaboration

*Plain text tools* in combination with *version control* offer
ways to edit files in parallel, without the risk of stepping on
each other's toes.  This in itself allows for a completely new way
of collaboration and could already be considered a key benefit.
Actually it is *no* buzzphrase when we say that we can't imagine
how we could ever have worked efficiently before.

One effect of this is that tasks can be assigned much more flexibly
than with traditional toolchains and workflows in which documents
have to be passed along from one person to the next.  As everybody
has simultaneous access to the whole data repository everybody is
able to do anything that is currently necessary.  This “everybody”
can also include *you* as our customer.  With some training you
can join the process, save some money and gain control over the
process by, say, doing proof-reading yourself.

### Crowd Engraving: Online Collaboration on Speed

But this can be taken to yet another level.  Collaborating on a
shared data repository also implies that work can be distributed
among *any number* of contributors.  Preparing a musical edition
with versioned workflows is essentially the same thing as
collaboratively developing software - we simply take the tools and
strategies from computer sciences and bring them to the realm of
musical editing!

This can significantly speed up the delivery of the
finished product: if you can assign the work of music entry to a
number of contributors the overall processing time will be reduced
accordingly:  20 engravers can finish a large score in about a 20th
of the time needed by a single engraver.

#### Use Cases

- Huge editing projects like the 1.600 pages [Liedboek](http://www.liedboek.nl/)
  that was completed in less than a year.  (This project was realized
  before our activity, but it has been a big inspiration for us.)
- Large scores that have to be finished on short notice, e.g. because
  the orchestral rehearsals are approaching too rapidly.
- Projects that are *intended* as community achievements.

Our first reference project will be finished in 2014/15: the
preparation of performance material for Oskar Fried's cantata
[“Das Trunkne Lied”](http://lilypondblog.org/2013/06/das-trunkne-lied/).
And currently we're discussing to start a complete edition of XXX, an
important Portuguese composer, covering around 2.200 pages of mostly
orchestral music.
