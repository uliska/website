**Creating musical documents ...**  
... is one of the key areas of a musical
service provider.  Our offers in this field include:

- Scores in *publication quality* or in a *standard quality*
  serving gracefully for most needs.
- Performance material (for example for choirs and orchestras).
- Transpositions (e.g. of songs).
- Editions from manuscript (with scholarly standards upon request).
- Books with text and music (songbooks and musicological books).


**Score Engraving**  
Our notation program of choice, [LilyPond](http://www.lilypond.org),
provides exceptional engraving according to the ideals of traditional,
hand-engraved scores.  In particular it produces exceptionally
readable output even without manual adjustments.  Thus, if you are
exclusively looking for performance or study material, you can
save time and money by ordering a *standard quality* score which
should be good enough for most uses.

The visual appearance of LilyPond's output can be configured up to
the least detail, offering great stylistical diversity.  We have
developed a set of default stylesheets to choose from, all
tailored for perfect readability on the music stand.  We can
also design an individual “house style” for you, giving your
productions a unique and recognisable appearance.

**Book Typesetting**  
Many people don't know about the impact that typography has on the
readability of texts. With [LaTeX](http://www.latex-project.org)
you don't have to worry about this aspect because *any* document will
be laid out perfectly, according to proven typesetting standards.
Out of the box you will enjoy typographical quality that you'd *never*
achieve with word processors and that is completely up to par with *any*
professional publishing tool on the market.

Of particular interest is the ability to mix text and music with
high-quality results.  There are several solutions ready to use for
different purposes like score editions with intermingled text parts
or musicological books/documents with music examples.  We have
developed our own LaTeX package
[lilyglyphs](http://www.openlilylib.org/lilyglyphs) which allows the
user to insert *any* notational elements like ordinary characters in
continuous text.  This is a perfect solution for critical reports,
but it can also be used in general-purpose music books.


**Scholarly Review**  
As we have musicological expertise within our
[core team](@root_path/contact-about) we can offer one-stop services
around the creation of musical scores and documents.  Whether you're
simply looking for thorough and professional proof-reading, need
advice on editorial decisions or intend to produce an edition from 
scratch based on obscure manuscript sources - just ask and we'll
determine what we can do for you.  In addition we can write
accompanying texts or do independent research and author scholarly
documents.


**Benefits from the Nature of our Tools**  
We are working exclusively with programs processing *plain text*
input files, and our workflows are based on *version control* and
online collaboration.  This implies a number of features you can
read about on [Benefits](@root_path/benefits).  Of particular
interest with regard to our document preparation services are:

- Seamless online collaboration  
  warranting efficient work and improving quality
- Option to join the process yourself  
  if you want to look after everything yourself or save time and money
- Use of libraries and custom commands  
  for any specific issues like editorial annotations, special symbols etc.
