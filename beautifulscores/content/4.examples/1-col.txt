We have developed a set of stylesheets that can be simply
applied to your music, giving it a beautiful, readable
appearance out-of-the-box. Styles range from *classical* over
*modern* and *jazz* to *fancy*.
But we can also design a “house style” for you, which can go as
far as modifying the used notation font to create an individual
appearance.

Another differenciation comes into play when you consider the
level of attention to typographic detail. We can provide scores
from default quality to minutely beautified works of art.
If you are used to working with scores created with usual
graphical tools you may not expect this to be possible, but
LilyPond's notation meets the demands for most
people and use cases short of publication out-of-the-box.
This is something where you actually can save money if you just
need performance material.
