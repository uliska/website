### Ready-to-use Stylesheets

On this page you can see a selection of score examples using
our ready-to-use stylesheets.  If one of them offers the right
style for you, we're all set and can start engraving your music
right away.  Click on the thumbnails to view full-page PDF examples.

#### *Default* Style

This is the visual appearance LilyPond creates by default.
So there is nothing to be done to adapt the style except adjusting
some basic page layout values.

Use: Janek's choir settings (Dvorak)?  
A set of images: Small png files as thumbnails arranged horizontally.  
clicking opens one page of PDF.

#### *Modern* Style

This is the style we created for our first big edition, the
revised edition of Oskar Fried's songs.  It offers a very
elegant and modern look while preserving the hand-engraved,
rather bold appearance we love from LilyPond.  Please note
that this style makes use of non-free text fonts, so you can't
simply recreate scores with this appearance yourself without
acquiring the used fonts.

Use: Fried edition

#### *Classical* Style

This is a style explicitly looking backwards, using a text font
often used in 19th century music engraving.

Use: ???


#### *Jazz* Style

Some time ago members of the community provided a way to use a
dedicated Jazz font for engraving lead sheets and similar scores.
While this is not Lilypond's original domain the results are
very appealing.
