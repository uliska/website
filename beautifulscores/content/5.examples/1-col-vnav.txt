The output offered by our notation software of choice,
[LilyPond](http://www.lilypond.org) is not only of 
exceptional quality but also shows remarkable versatility.
To get an impression on the diversity of historical styles
that can be engraved with LilyPond please visit the
[Examples](http://www.lilypond.org/examples.html "LilyPond Home Page")
page on LilyPond's home page.  On this page we provide you
with a set of differently *looking* LilyPond scores.

**Style Sheets**  
With plain text files it is usually a simple matter of
exchanging *one* file include to apply a completely
different style to a document.  We have developed a
set of stylesheets, giving our scores a beautiful,
readable appearance out-of-the-box.  Styles range
from *classical* over *modern* and *jazz* to *fancy*.
Browse our [gallery](@root_path/examples/styles) of
reference scores to get an impression of these different
styles and the overall quality of our engraving.

In addition to our set of ready-to-use styles we can also
design a “house style” for you, which can go as
far as modifying the used notation font to create a unique
appearance.  This can really make your publications stand apart.
Have a look at some [challenges](@root_path/examples/house-styles)
we took to achieve specific styles.

**Automated Engraving and Out-of-the-box Quality**  
DTP programs that *compile* plain text input files produce
better default output than WYSIWYG tools - by design.
They can consider significantly more layout factors *because*
they don't have to deliver *instant results*.  This may sound
academic, but actually it has an enormous real-life impact.
Scores entered in LilyPond are usually immediately usable,
for anything short of publication.  No need to touch
everything and drag objects around in arbitrary ways just to be
able to read the score at all.  What this means is: For many
use cases you don't have to bother - and pay - for manually fixing
stuff that the software didn't manage to get right by itself.
While developing the
*content* of a score you only have to deal with the *content*.

We explicitly offer scores in _standard_ quality, and we're positive
that already these scores will be more enjoyable for musicians
than the majority of scores they're exposed to usually.
This is something where you actually can save money if you're
just interested in performance or instructional material.  See
for yourself with our [comparisons](@root_path/examples/quality)
between LilyPond's out-of-the-box engraving and scores manually
tuned to perfection.  To make this even more telling we also
created a set of [comparison examples](@root_path/examples/comparisons)
with LilyPond's WYSIWYG competitors.
