### Comparing Default Output

To some it may seem pointless to compare the default output of
different programs because that's not what you're after
anyway.  But that completely misses the point.  It's exactly
this quality of LilyPond's default output that makes it so
tremenduously practical in daily use.  There are so many occasions
and use cases where you simply don't have to touch the default
output anymore after having entered the plain *content*.

Have a look at LilyPond's following attempt at a piano reduction
of an orchestral score by Arnold Schoenberg:


**Add correct copyright notice**

This example is clearly not publication ready.  But while you
could bring it to that state with just a handful of careful tweaks
the original state is already readable and playable, and it
doesn't prevent you from doing scholarly editing or proof-reading.
If that doesn't convince you then please look at what *Finale 2014*
produced from the same entered music:

- Finale version

You wouldn't be able to play from that without first starting to
drag everything around.

Now to something different: Look at this complex piano score from
Leopold Godowsky's free transcription of Chopin's “Winterwind”
study:

- Godowsky *Winterwind*, Sibelius version

The editor had really to force himself not to start dragging around
notes etc, because *Sibelius 7*'s output was barely readable at all:

- LilyPond's result (TODO?) with comment (TODO)


So, what's the deal with this issue?
If you can't simply enter *music* but immediately have to fix
shortcomings of your layout program this simply counts as
unnecessary extra work you have to do (or pay for).  But maybe
even more imporantly this *contaminates* your document right
from the start because with WYSIWYG tools you'll usually never
get your score back to a state of pure music entry, it will
always contain obscure manual tweaks that you can't conveniently
revert because the software is actually hiding them from you.
