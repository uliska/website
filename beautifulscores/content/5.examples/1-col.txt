On this page you can get an impression of the versatility
of our notation software [LilyPond](http://www.lilypond.org)
and our work.  Of course you can expect similar virtues
from our book typesetting but for these examples we
concentrate on music.

**Style Sheets**  
With plain text files it is usually a simple matter of
exchanging *one* included file to apply a completely
different style to a document - be it a score or a text.
This can for example be used to have a different layout
while working on the *content*, but this application is
further described on [Tools](@root_path/tools).  
We have developed a set of stylesheets, giving our scores
a beautiful, readable appearance out-of-the-box.  Styles
range from *classical* over *modern* and *jazz* to *fancy*.
Browse our **\[gallery\]** of reference scores to get an
impression of these different styles and the overall
quality of our engraving.
But we can also design a “house style” for you, which can go as
far as modifying the used notation font to create a unique
appearance making your publications stand apart.  Have a look
at some **\[challenges\]** to achieve specific styles.

**Automatic Engraving and Out-of-the-box Quality**  
DTP programs that *compile* plain text input files produce
better default output than WYSIWYG tools - by design.
They can consider significantly more layout factors *because*
they don't have to deliver *instant results*.  This may sound
academic, but actually it has an enormous real-life impact.
Scores entered in LilyPond are usually immediately usable,
for anything short of publication.  No need to touch
everything and drag objects around in arbitrary ways just to be
able to read the score at all.  What this means is: For many
use cases you don't have to bother - and pay - for manually fixing
stuff that the software didn't manage to get right by itself.
And this means that you will only have to “contaminate” the
documents with manual interventions when actually preparing a
beautified printout.  While developing the *content* of a score
you only have to deal with the content.

We explicitly offer scores in a default quality, trusting our
tools to produce usable results by themselves.
This is something where you actually can save money if you're just
interested in usable material. See for yourself with our
**\[Quality Comparison\]** between LilyPond's out-of-the-box
engraving and scores manually tuned to perfection.  To make this
even more telling we also created a set of examples comparing
LilyPond's default output quality with that of its graphical
competitors.

### Some comparisons:

(These list items have to be mapped to the subpages referenced above)

- One score with different styles (beautified):
  - LilyPond default output
  - modern style like Fried songs
  - dedicated "classical" style (I don't know if we have this already)
  - Should be add the UE style here?
- One score with out-of-the-box quality and beautified engraving  
  This should be an example that
  - clearly shows the difference
  - demonstrates the "usefulness" of out-of-the-box output  
    (i.e. isn't too embarrassing)
- Comparison of out-of-the-box result of LilyPond and Finale  
  and the development from 2.12-2.19 vs. Finale 2008-2014
- Examples of specific “house styles”
  - Kieren's Henle style  
    (don't name it, just say: "Who recognizes it?")
  - Our UE style (with development)
