The output offered by our notation software of choice,
[LilyPond](http://www.lilypond.org) is not only of 
exceptional quality but also shows remarkable versatility.
To get an impression on the diversity of historical styles
that can be engraved with LilyPond please visit the
[Examples](http://www.lilypond.org/examples.html "LilyPond Home Page")
page on LilyPond's home page.  On this page we provide you
with a set of differently *looking* LilyPond scores.

**Style Sheets**  
With plain text files it is usually a simple matter of
exchanging *one* file include to apply a completely
different style to a document.  We have developed a
set of stylesheets, giving our scores a beautiful,
readable appearance out-of-the-box.  Styles range
from *classical* over *modern* and *jazz* to *fancy*.
In addition to our set of ready-to-use styles we can also
design a “house style” for you, which can go as
far as modifying the used notation font to create a unique
appearance.  This can really make your publications stand apart.

**Automated Engraving and Out-of-the-box Quality**  
LilyPond's declared goal is “automated engraving”, meaning
that the software will make informed layout decisions based
on the craftsmanship of traditional plate-engraving.  This may
sound academic, but actually it has an enormous real-life impact.
Scores entered in LilyPond are usually immediately usable,
for anything short of publication.  No need to touch
everything and drag objects around in arbitrary ways just to make
the score legible.  What this means is: For many
use cases you don't have to bother with - or pay for - manually fixing
stuff that the software didn't manage to get right by itself.

We explicitly offer scores in _standard_ quality, and we're positive
that they will be more enjoyable for musicians
than the majority of scores they're usually exposed to.
Well, if you look at the following examples, can you actually 
distinguish the *publication* and the *standard* quality examples?
