### “House Style” Examples

To give you an impression how versatile LilyPond really can get
we present you some examples of styles we developed with certain
prominent models in mind.  We won't name them but leave it to
you to guess what we were trying to achieve.  
We are working on an Open Source stylesheet library which will
provide a uniform interface and enable everybody to choose
from a whole range of community-driven styles.

The second example is really a sketch and “under construction”.
One important thing to note with this example is that we actually
modified LilyPond's notation font to achieve the desired result.
Please note that if we should do something like this to design a
house stlye for you such a font modification is required to be
licensed by a free license and to be made publicly available.
The examples are used as a proof-of-concept, and the font modification
is very incomplete - for example we modified the *p* but no other
Dynamic letters.
