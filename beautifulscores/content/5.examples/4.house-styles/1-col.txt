### “House Style” Examples

To give you an impression how versatile LilyPond really can get
we present you some examples of styles we developed with certain
prominent models in mind.  We won't name them but leave it to
you to guess what we were trying to achieve.  
Additionally we are working on an Open Source stylesheet library
which will provide a uniform interface and enable everybody to
choose from a whole range of community-driven styles.

Have a look at this well-known Beethoven Sonata. Doesn't it look
like xeroxed from the famous blue edition?  If you print it please
make sure not to shrink to paper size - it looks better if
you crop the margins than making the score itself less weighty by
downscaling it to A4 paper. 

- Henle (Kieren)

The second example is really a sketch and “under construction”.
One important thing to note with this example is that we actually
modified LilyPond's notation font to achieve the desired result.
Please note that if we should do something like this to design a
house stlye for you such a font modification is required to be
licensed by a free license and to be made publicly available.
The examples are used as a proof-of-concept, and the font modification
is very incomplete - for example we modified the *p* but no other
Dynamic letters.

- UE style (my style copy)


As a final example we created a score with a stylish look and feel
that is quite far away from what you'd usually expect from a notation
program that is so enthusiastic about “traditional” engraving.  We
present it at this place to demonstrate how “different” your scores
could look if you want to have it that way.

- Add a non-sensical (?) “fancy” style example? Maybe using "Ubuntu" as font.
