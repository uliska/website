### Automated Engraving

One of LilyPond's particular strengths is it's exceptional
out-of-the-box engraving quality.  More often than not the
default output even of complex scores is perfectly
suitable for most purposes.  Even when missing perfect
publication quality it's usually very readable right away,
so you can use the scores for comfortable reading
without messing around with manual layout corrections.
This becomes particularly apparent with complex rhythmic
settings, or with intense polyphony as seen in the following
excerpt from *Gethsemane*, a fragment by Arnold Schoenberg
(displayed courtesy of Larry Schoenberg) - which is engraved
*without a single manual correction* (!)):

This astonishing clarity is a direct result of LilyPond's
*compiled* approach that allows it to have a very strong
internal representation of the musical content and consider
an enormous number of factors before making its layout
decisions.  But it's also a consequence of the developers'
passion to make *automated engraving* even better - instead
of inventing more and more fancy user functions to feed
the marketing office.  Your scores will even improve with
LilyPond, without your further attention.

Not all scores come that close to perfection out-of-the-box.
But as you can see from the following comparison of a default
engraving with the manually beautified score the imperfections
are much less likely to interfere with the readability of the
score - you could perfectly use the score on the music stand or
for further editing without having to fiddle around with making
it readable at all.  This characteristic behaviour makes LilyPond
scores very robust, but also very efficient.

- Fried song?
- other score?
- complicated instrumental part

While this is already very impressive we couldn't help but
preparing a set of examples comparing this behaviour to that
of the leading commercial WYSIWYG notation programs, which
you can see on our [comparison](@root_path/examples/comparisons)
page.
