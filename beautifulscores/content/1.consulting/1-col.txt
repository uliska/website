As you probably know from other pages on our website we are working
with a set of innovative tools, bringing the toolkit of software
development to the realm of musical engraving and editing.
These tools help *us* - but *you* can also benefit from them by
adapting your specific engraving and publishing business.

We would be happy to assist you in finding your way into that
world of *plain text*, *source code*, *versioning* and *command line work*.
The nice thing is: Even during this process we can make use of
the advantages of our collaborative workflows.

#### Analysis
In a first step we'll listen to what you can tell us about your
business and make suggestions which investment we consider worthwile.
There are several partial solutions that can also make sense
independently:

- *Using LilyPond for score engraving*  
  Of course his is where our origins are, so this is our initial
  concern.  But there are other ways of benefitting from plain
  text approaches too.
- *Using LaTeX for maintaining text documents*  
  This can be made useful even independently, so depending on
  your business and interests we can implement this part of the
  toolkit alone.
- *Preparing scores and texts for online access*  
  Contents maintained as plain text are highly accessible
  to web services and other forms of single-source publishing.
  This can be an interesting option when you want to distribute
  music (maybe even music-on-demand) online, or when you want
  to provide searchable databases of, say, critical reports.

#### Software Set-up
Setting up your software systems consists of two independent parts:
*installing* and configuring software and *setting up* the toolkits.

- *Installing* and *Configuration*  
  Determining the necessary software to be run on your client computers
  and servers or deciding about creating accounts with external service
  providers is the basis for any additional work. As *all* relevant tools
  are freely available as open source software you won't have to
  calculate any costs for buying or licensing software.  The tools run
  on all major operating systems, so you're not bound to any platform.
- *Individual Toolkit*  
  This *can* be a significant amount of work, depending on the
  specificity of your applications.  If you're simply going to use
  tools and functionality we have already available it's really not
  more than a matter of software configuration.  
  But we can provide a lot more than that: fine-tuning everything to
  your business' requirements, creating individual stylesheets or
  even a complete infrastructure for advanced applications like
  manuscript management, database management of musical snippets
  or whatever you might need.
  

#### Fundamental Training
It can't be denied that getting fluent with plain text based work is
something that needs time to get used to.  But we're absolutely
convinced that it is more than worth the investment.  On the long run
but already after some initial accomodation time.  To assist you finding
your way through this area we can provide fundamental training for
version control, LilyPond and LaTeX usage, online or with local workshops
and training units.

#### Mentoring
All necessary tools can be learned by looking for free resources, becoming
member of communities or buying books.  But it is significantly more
efficient to have some *mentoring*, that is someone who can be asked 
the currently relevant question and who will answer exactly in the
context that is currently interesting.  We won't leave you alone after
initial set-up but will be around to get you going until you can walk alone.

One cool feature has been mentioned in another context: *Joining the process yourself.*
This is also an ideal way to get the mentoring and training “on the job”, while
being able to directly jump into real-world projects without having to
postpone everything until you're ready to use the new technology.  To make
it short: *We* start doing the work, *you* can start to take over more
and more work and responsability, and finally you can do everything 
on your own.

#### Support
When you are completely set up, have learned enough to walk alone and
are already doing your stuff by yourself, we can still be around to
give occasional support.  Again: The nature of our collaborative tools
will enable us not only to answer any questions, but also to directly
access the project repositories and do any cleaning up that might be
necessary. If you didn't manage to completely spoil something on your
client computer we should always be able to help you out online.
