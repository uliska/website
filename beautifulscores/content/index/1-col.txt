**beautifulScores**  
is a group of music engravers offering innovative
and unique services when it comes to typesetting scores or music books.
We are committed to creating beautiful scores with that old-fashioned
plate-engraved appearance that makes them so readable on the music stand.
At the same time we are using and tailoring cutting-edge tools and strategies,
bringing technology and workflows from software development to the realm of
music engraving and scholarly editing.

**Engraving and Typesetting**  
Engraving beautiful scores is our passion, the same is true for the
quality of typesetting in (music) books.  Our offers as an engraving
service provider include:

- Scores in *publication quality* or in a *default quality* serving
  gracefully for most needs.
- Performance material (for example for choirs and orchestras).
- Transpositions (e.g. of songs).
- Editions from manuscript (with scholarly standards upon request).
- Books with text and music (songbooks and musicological books).

**The Future For your Business**  
We can do much more for you than simply producing documents.  In
addition we can assist you with implementing future-oriented
technologies in your edition and engraving business.
The secret lies in the use of *version control* and *plain text
based tools*: [LilyPond](http://www.lilypond.org) for engraving
scores and [LaTeX](http://www.latex-project.org) for typesetting
texts.  Apart from providing excellent output quality these tools
can give key benefits to your working environment ...

- *Long-term reliability* through self-documenting projects.
- *Seamless collaboration* providing smooth workflows and improving
  the overall quality of your results.
- *Integration of text and music* with remarkable ease.
- *Flexibility* in setting up working environments.

... to name just a few. Read more about the underlying
