**beautifulScores**  
is a group of music engravers offering innovative
and unique services when it comes to typesetting scores or music books.
We are committed to creating beautiful scores with that old-fashioned
plate-engraved appearance that makes them so readable on the music stand.
At the same time we are using and tailoring cutting-edge tools and strategies,
bringing technology and workflows from software development to the realm of
music engraving and scholarly editing.

**Engraving and Typesetting**  
Beautifully produced scores and texts are our passion, and that's
what we deliver. We produce scores for publication or as exceptionally
readable performance material, also (scholarly) editions from
manuscript, and books mixing text and music.  Read more about key
features that make us stand apart on [Typesetting](@root_path/typesetting).

**Editing and Writing**  
In addition to technical and aesthetical competence we can also provide
musicological expertise for your projects.  You can get professional
proof-reading or scholarly review, or we can even create critical
editions from manuscript sources and write about it, so this is the
one-stop shop for your engraving and editing needs.

**Scalable Online Collaboration**  
A key benefit of our toolchain is highly efficient
online collaboration. The secret lies in the use of *version control*
and *plain text based tools* making completely new workflows possible.
These scale very well and we can distribute work among any number
of contributors, either to speed up delivery or to tackle
specific tasks.  Read more on [Crowd Engraving](@root_path/crowd-engraving).
