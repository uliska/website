**beautifulScores**  
is a group of music engravers offering innovative
and unique services when it comes to typesetting scores or music books.
We are committed to creating beautiful scores with that old-fashioned
plate-engraved appearance that makes them so readable on the music stand.
At the same time we are using and tailoring cutting-edge tools and strategies,
bringing technology and workflows from software development to the realm of
music engraving and scholarly editing.

Beautyfully produced scores and texts are our passion, and that's
what we deliver. We produce scores for publication or as exceptionally
readable performance material, also (scholarly) editions from
manuscript, and books mixing text and music.  Read more about key

musicological expertise for your projects.  You can get professional
proof-reading or scholarly review, or we can even create critical
editions from manuscript sources and write about it, so this is the
one-stop shop for your engraving and editing needs.
