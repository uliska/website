This is the home of <span class="OLL">openLilyLib</span>, a family of resources for people interested in engraving beautiful music with [LilyPond](http://www.lilypond.org) and typesetting beautiful texts about music with [LaTeX](http://www.latex-project.org/).
It was initiated by a group of LilyPond users who are enthusiastic with Free Software and want to share their personal LilyPond and LaTeX 'toolboxes'.

<p class="box">
<span class="OLL">openLilyLib</span> or <span class="OLL">OLLib</span> is the core of the project.
It is a toolbox library that extends LilyPond with usability as its main focus.
One key concept of <span class="OLL">openLilyLib</span> is its extensive documentation.
This is intended not only to allow the usage of the library but to serve as a resource to get a deeper understanding of LilyPond.<br />

<p class="box">
The <strong>Tutorials</strong> section will contain a (hopefully growing) number of tutorials on specific topics of engraving scores with LilyPond.
They range from short HowTos to full-fledged tutorials.<br />

<p class="box">
<strong>lilyglyphs</strong> is a LaTeX package that allows to use LilyPond's notational elements as normal text objets in (Xe)LaTeX documents.<br />

<p class="box">
<strong>musicexamples</strong> is a LaTeX package that manages music examples.
It provides floating and non-floating environments and commands to print music examples with one or more systems as well as full-page examples (with robust support for examples starting on odd/even pages).
All example types share the same counter and are assembled in one <code>\listofmusicexamples</code>.<br />
