As its name already suggests <span class="OLL">openLilyLib</span> or <span class="OLL">OLLib</span> is the heart of this project.
It came into existence when two LilyPond users, Urs Liska and Janek Warcho≈Ç worked on a larger-scale edition with LilyPond and organized their tools and helpers in form of a library.
As they got much assistance from the [lilypond-user](https://lists.gnu.org/mailman/listinfo/lilypond-user) mailing list and as they are interested in Free Software in general they decided to release their work as an open source library.
As a first step in the library's development cycle, all useable functions from our private library will be transferred to the new open library, and we'll merge all useable functions from Jan-Peter Voigt's personal library and will open up the project for contributions from the community.

<span class="OLL">openLilyLib</span> shares some concepts with the [LilyPond Snippet Repository](http://lsr.dsi.unimi.it/LSR/) in that it provides tools and functions that extend LilyPond's functionality, support document authors and helps getting a deeper understanding of LilyPond.
But there are also fundamental differences to the LSR in that the library presents a coherent user interface to its functions and extensive documentation.
This documentation is intended to be useful not only for actually *using* the library but also as a reference material to improve the reader's understanding how to efficiently develop LilyPond scores.
Beyond that <span class="OLL">openLilyLib</span> has a quite strong focus on useability enhancements, while the LSR is a collection of *any* interesting functions.

The core of <span class="OLL">openLilyLib</span> is a library that provides access to its functions, tools and shorthands through a consistent user interface.
Some other items (e.g. engravers or building blocks) can be included or activated individually because it doesn't make sense to include them automatically.
Additionally <span class="OLL">openLilyLib</span> provides a set of examples that demonstrate the use of the library or other concepts.
These can be used as-is or taken as building blocks for own developments.
These examples are intended to be well-documented so they can be taken as mini-tutorials complementing the "official" tutorials section.
