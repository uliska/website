<span class="XMP">lilyglyphs</span> is a package that allows to use (virtually any) notational element from LilyPond as a normal element in the continuous text of (Xe)LaTeX documents.
Glyphs from LilyPond's Emmentaler music font can be accessed through predefined commands like <code>\clefG</code> (for a G clef) or directly through the glyph name, like <code>\lilyGlyph{scripts.ufermata}</code>.
Other symbols which LilyPond draws itself are made accessible through pdf image files.
Python scripts have been provided to streamline the generation of these pdf images, so it has become simple to extend the library of predefined commands.

Different from other approaches we know of <span class="XMP">lilyglyphs</span> glyphs scale well with the surrounding font size.
