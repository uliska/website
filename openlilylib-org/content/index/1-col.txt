This is the home of <span class="OLL">openlilylib</span>, a family of resources
for people interested in engraving beautiful music with
[LilyPond](http://www.lilypond.org) and typesetting beautiful texts about music
with [LaTeX](http://www.latex-project.org/).  It was initiated by Urs Liska who
assembled a group of LilyPond users who are enthusiastic with Free Software.

The original motivation for creating this project and website was to make our
personal toolboxes available in an open source LilyPond library.  This library
is focused on usability extensions for LilyPond, and it is partially intended
as a testbed for improvements to be suggested for inclusion in future LilyPond releases.
However, it soon became clear that we would host a whole family of subprojects
but we decided to keep the original name for the library, so
<span class="OLL">openlilylib</span> now stands both for the library itself and
for the project as a whole.

If you're interested in any aspect of <span class="OLL">openlilylib</span> don't
hesitate to contact us through [info@openlilylib.org](mailto:info@openlilylib.org).
The development home page where you can browse all code and get downloads is
our [Github organization](https://github.com/openlilylib).  
<span class="OLL">openLilyLib</span>'s highlighted subprojects are:

<div class="box">
<p><span class="OLL">openlilyib</span>, the core library.  It is a toolbox library
that extends LilyPond with usability as its main focus.  It aims to provide a lot
of shorthands and useful functions to smoothen and enhance your editing experience
with LilyPond. &mdash; <a href="library">Read more ...</a></p>
</div>

<div class="box">
<p><span class="OLL">lilypond-doc</span></br />
This will become a set of tools to document LilyPond scores and libraries.
The focus lies equally on defining an API documentation scheme to build docs for library files and on providing tools to document and comment the contents of scores in situ.

</div>

<div class="box">
<p><span class="OLL">tutorials</span></br />
This section will contain a (hopefully growing) number of tutorials on specific topics of engraving scores with LilyPond.
They range from short howtos to full-fledged tutorials.

</div>

<div class="box">
<p><span class="OLL">lilyglyphs</span><br /> 
This is a LaTeX package that allows to use virtually all of LilyPond's notational elements as normal characters in (Xe)LaTeX documents.

<div class="box">
<p><span class="OLL">musicexamples</span><br />
This is a LaTeX package that manages music examples.
It provides floating and non-floating environments and commands to print music examples with one or more systems as well as full-page examples (with robust support for examples starting on odd/even pages).
All example types share the same counter and can be assembled in one list of musicexamples.
