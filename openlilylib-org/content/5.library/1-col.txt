title:The openlilylib Library
-
content:
As its name already suggests <span class="OLL">openlilyib</span> is the heart
of this project.  The idea came into existence when two LilyPond users,
Urs Liska and Janek Warcho≈Ç worked on a larger-scale edition with LilyPond and
organized their tools and helpers in form of a library.  Since they got much
assistance from the [lilypond-user](https://lists.gnu.org/mailman/listinfo/lilypond-user)
mailing list and as they are interested in Free Software in general they decided
to release their work as an open source library.


<span class="OLL">openlilylib</span> shares some concepts with the
[LilyPond Snippet Repository](http://lsr.dsi.unimi.it/LSR/) in that it provides
tools and functions that extend LilyPond's functionality, support document authors
and help getting a deeper understanding of LilyPond.  But there are also
fundamental differences to the LSR:

- The LSR is an official part of LilyPond while <span class="OLL">openlilylib</span>
  is not.  Parts of the LSR are also part of the official LilyPond documentation.
- The LSR works on a given version of LilyPond and can therefore be somewhat
  hard to keep up to date.
- While the snippets from the LSR have to be copied and pasted into users'
  documents, <span class="OLL">openlilylib</span> is designed as an *includable*
  library.
- <span class="OLL">openlilylib</span> resides on Github and offers convenient
  interfaces for collaboration.

The development home page of <span class="OLL">openlilylib</span> is at
[GitHub](https://github.com/openlilylib/openlilylib).  There you can browse
the library and read some examples and documentation.  To use
<span class="OLL">openlilylib</span> you can

- copy snippets directly from the web site,
- download the whole repository as a ZIP file  
  or (preferred)
- clone the Git repository directly  
  (giving you automatic updates and the possibility to contribute)
